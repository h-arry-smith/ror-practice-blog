# Ruby On Rails 5 Practice Projects - Project One - Personal Blog
This code is part of a larger project of 5 RoR practice projects of increasing difficulty.
The goal of this project is to develop, memorise and practice building non trivial applications in Rails.
I've been documenting my daily progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/h_arry_smith/status/1556562757910134786).
I'm publishing all the code from these projects on github in case they are ever of any use to another beginner.

## Project Aims
- Create a basic blog platform that someone could self host
- Have an admin interface for a single super user to create articles and tags
- Explore articles by tags
- Provide basic authentication and authorization with a default password flow

## Key Learnings
- Deviating from the 'rails way' will cause issues
- When unsure where to begin, starting with a route and letting the error messages guide you is helpful
- Partial templates are your friend and are a massive help in views
- Forms are a lot easier to reason about when they have a model associated with them
